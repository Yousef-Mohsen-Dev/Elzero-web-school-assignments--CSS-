# Elzero Web School - CSS Assignments 🎨

This repository showcases my solutions for the **Elzero Web School CSS course**. As the second major step in my front-end development journey, this collection of projects demonstrates my progress in turning structured HTML into visually appealing and responsive web pages.

Building on the foundation of HTML, these assignments were crucial for learning how to control layout, color, typography, and interactivity with modern CSS techniques.

## 🎯 What I Learned

This course provided hands-on practice with the most essential aspects of CSS. Key skills I developed include:

* 🎨 **Advanced Selectors & The Cascade:** Mastering specificity, inheritance, and using a wide range of selectors to target elements precisely.
* 📦 **The Box Model:** A deep dive into `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `content` to control element spacing and size.
* 📐 **Modern Layouts (Flexbox & Grid):** Building complex, responsive one-dimensional and two-dimensional layouts from scratch to structure pages effectively.
* 📱 **Responsive Design:** Using Media Queries to create seamless user experiences across different devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens.
* ✨ **Transitions & Animations:** Adding life and interactivity to the pages with smooth transitions and custom keyframe animations.
* 🔧 **CSS Variables:** Writing more maintainable, scalable, and reusable CSS by using custom properties for theming and consistency.
